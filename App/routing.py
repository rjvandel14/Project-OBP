# Vehicle routing and distance calculations

# Solves VRPs for individual and collaborative scenarios.
# Outputs route costs, distances, and truck requirements.

# Role: Solves VRPs for cost and route optimization.
# Interactions:
# With dss.py:
# Provides VRP solutions (costs, routes, truck usage) for individual companies or collaborations.
# Supports cost/savings calculations for DSS analysis.
# With ranking.py:
# Validates rankings by solving VRPs for selected partnerships.
# Provides ground truth for heuristic ranking evaluations.
