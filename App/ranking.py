# Partnership ranking methods

# Implements ranking logic and scoring features like overlap and cost savings.
# Validates rankings using heuristics and exact VRP results.

# Role: Implements ranking logic.
# Interactions:
# With dss.py:
# Provides ranking algorithms and outputs scores based on features like overlap and savings potential.
# Ensures rankings are consistent with DSS results by validating with small VRP solutions.
# With routing.py:
# Compares rankings to exact VRP solutions for validation (top and bottom-ranked partnerships).
